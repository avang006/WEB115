            <h1>Web 115_85 Course Contract</h1>
<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Alyssa Vang</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2019 WEB 115_85 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
